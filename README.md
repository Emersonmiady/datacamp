# DataCamp
I'm very thankful to my company __*ICMC JÃºnior*__, that has distributed the __*DataCamp*__ platform to its workers! \
So, this repository contains some files from the learning platform. I've used these to improve my knowledge about Data Science :) 

## Carrer Tracks
I really have loved the way that DataCamp teaches in __*Carrer Tracks*__, because it makes an objective path to follow, with a lot of courses!

## Projects
I've saved some projects here that were done by me. 

### Python
I've done these works to train my __*Python*__ and __*Data Analysis*__ skills. \
This path contains:
* *A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners;*
* *Disney Movies and Box Office Success;*
* *Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing;*
* *Exploring 67 years of LEGO;*
* *Exploring the Evolution of Linux;*
* *Predicting Credit Card Approvals;*
* *The Android App Market on Google Play;*
* *The GitHub History of the Scala Language;*
* *TV, Halftime Shows, and the Big Game.*

Observation: I recommend using the [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to visualize the .ipynb files.
